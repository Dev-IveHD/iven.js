# iven.js

A modular, interactive Discord Bot realized in NodeJS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

```
Node.js 8.12.0 or higher
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the bot up and running

Clone git repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ibveecnk/iven.js.git
```

Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Change token and prefix in botconfig.json or process.env (`Params: TOKEN | PREFIX`)

```
$ vi botconfig.json

```

Run the bot

```
$ node index.js
```

After having the bot added to a guild, try sending $ping ($ ressembles your prefix) and the bot should reply.
If that however doesn't work, please contact me via discord `@Iven#8562`
